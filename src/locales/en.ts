This is proof that our ancestors chose this place as an optimal living site thousands of years ago.\n- A Strategic Defense Point: During the Joseon Dynasty, it was an important passageway to protect Hanyang (Seoul) and held immense historical significance in connection with the nearby Haengjusanseong Fortress.' },

It boasts a smart location where you can reach major business districts within 10–20 minutes.\n\n### ③ The Pleasantness of a Planned City\nEverything is newly built, so the entire street is clean.
